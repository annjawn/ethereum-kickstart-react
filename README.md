# A Weather app written on React, Redux



### Overview

This web app is a crowdfunding application (like Kickstarter) build with Ethereum Smart Contracts written in Solidity and a Web UI written in ReactJS. The Smart contracts allows monetary transaction between backers and startups. Startups can request release of funds from backers based on project milestone requirements and backers and vote to approve release of fund or reject the request. This voting mechanism can potentially prevent fraud or misrepresentation by startups while insuring the backers invested money.

#### Technology Stack
This app makes use of the following Technologies

1. Web3
2. Solidity
3. Ganache CLI, and Mocha for Testing
4. React JS, react-router, and Semantic UI
6. Lodash

#### How it works
Using this App, startups can showcase their idea on the platform in form of deployed smart contracts and seek funding from backers to back their idea by pledging money. Backers can review startup ideas and pledge money into the ideas. Startups can periodically request funds at various periods of their projects with appropriate justifications,  the requests must be voted to approve by the backers. This voting mechanism enables safety net for the backers investment and prevents fraud and misrepresentation by startups thus ensuring only genuine startups are encouraged and help realize their ideas into products while insuring backer's investment to certain extent.
